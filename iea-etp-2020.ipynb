       "| 9 | 1 | 1 | description        | Today, the vast majority of PV modules are based on wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si). The manufacturing of c-Si modules typically involves growing ingots of silicon, slicing the ingots into wafers to make solar cells, electrically interconnecting the cells, and encapsulating the strings of cells to form a module. Modules currently use silicon in one of two main forms: single- (sc-Si) or multi- (mc-Si) crystalline modules. Current commercial single-crystalline modules have a higher conversion efficiency of around 14 to 20%. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 25% in the longer term. Multi-crystalline silicon modules have a more disordered atomic structure leading to lower efficiencies, but they are less expensive. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 21% in the long term. |\n",

       "9    Today, the vast majority of PV modules are based on wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si). The manufacturing of c-Si modules typically involves growing ingots of silicon, slicing the ingots into wafers to make solar cells, electrically interconnecting the cells, and encapsulating the strings of cells to form a module. Modules currently use silicon in one of two main forms: single- (sc-Si) or multi- (mc-Si) crystalline modules. Current commercial single-crystalline modules have a higher conversion efficiency of around 14 to 20%. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 25% in the longer term. Multi-crystalline silicon modules have a more disordered atomic structure leading to lower efficiencies, but they are less expensive. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 21% in the long term.\n",

       "5613 There is virtually no experience with mineral storage of CO2.  CarbFix is a pilot project in Iceland to demonstrate secure and permanent storage of CO2 in basalt rock formations. CO2, dissolved in water, reacts with the rock to form carbonate minerals. The CarbFix team has demonstrated that over 95% of the injected CO2 was converted into rock in less than two years. The same concept has also been evaluated at the Wallula test site in Washington State, United States, and has been advocated for offshore areas where basalt is widespread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

The manufacturing of c-Si modules typically involves growing ingots of silicon, slicing the ingots into wafers to make solar cells, electrically interconnecting the cells, and encapsulating the strings of cells to form a module. Modules currently use silicon in one of two main forms: single- (sc-Si) or multi- (mc-Si) crystalline modules. Current commercial single-crystalline modules have a higher conversion efficiency of around 14 to 20%. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 25% in the longer term. Multi-crystalline silicon modules have a more disordered atomic structure leading to lower efficiencies, but they are less expensive. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 21% in the long term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>* Crystalline silicon technology is the dominating technology today, wih a share of around 95% in total PV cell production in 2017                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>US-DOE SunShot 2030 targets:\n",

In the case of two cells, it will form a double junction, also called a tandem cell. Stacking more cells together forms a triple or a quadruple junction. In all cases, the upper cell(s) must be as transparent as possible to enable the lower cells to still be active. This approach enables a broader spectrum of sunlight to be captured, and overall efficiency to be increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Multi-junction PV modules are mainly used for satellite PV and concentrating PV (CPV) systems.

Efficiencies are much lower than silicon-based PV systems, but production costs are also expected to be much lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Materials            , Renewable electricity, Systems integration  , Hydrogen             , Synthetic fuels      </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Germany  , Australia</span></td></tr>\n",

A synthetic oil transfers the heat from the collector pipes to heat exchangers, producing superheated steam to run a steam turbine and produce electricity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Parabolic troughs accounted in 2018 with a capacity of 4114 MW for around three quarters of global solar thermal electricity capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>US-DOE SunShot 2030 targets:\n",

The main advantage of LFR systems is that their simple design of flexibly bent mirrors and fixed receivers requires lower investment costs and facilitates direct steam generation, thereby eliminating the need for – and cost of – heat transfer fluids and heat exchangers. LFR plants are, however, less efficient than troughs in converting solar energy to electricity and it is more difficult to incorporate storage capacity into their design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Linear fresnel reflectors accounted in 2018 with a capacity of 185 MW for 4% of global solar thermal electricity capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>US-DOE SunShot 2030 targets:\n",

There is a diversity of designs of AWES but these can be broadly categorised as either lift type devices creating torque on a ground generator via their tether, or drag type devices with airborne generators and conductive tethers. AWES offer several potential advantages over conventional wind turbines. They require less material than towerbased turbines, have the potential to be manufactured at lower cost, can be deployed faster and can harness stronger and steadier winds by flying at higher altitudes. AWES technologies are at varying stages of maturity for a variety of applications ranging from small scale off grid power provision in remote locations to large scale offshore power production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td><td>After successful onshore tests Makani Power started to test in 2019 a 600 kW kite offshore in non-power generating flight.

Offshore wind turbines do not face similar transport size limitations to onshore wind turbines so a divergence in maximum size is also likely to continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>NULL</td><td>NULL</td></tr>\n",

Floating offshore turbines offer the potential for lower seabed impact, simplified installation and decommissioning, and access to additional wind resource at water depths exceeding 50 m to 60 m. Floating platforms may also be attractive for mid-depth projects, where saturation of onshore or near-shore potential or the possibility of standardising floating platform designs do not necessarily need heavy-lift vessels to transport platforms or install turbine towers and nacelles. They may therefore ultimately permit greater upscaling of wind turbines than seabed fixed technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>12 projects are in operation, with a combined capacity of 57 MW, with project size having increased from 0.08 MW in 2009 to 30 MW by 2017.\n",

In these high-temperature reservoirs, the liquid water component boils, or “flashes,” as pressure drops. Separated steam is piped to a turbine to generate electricity and the remaining hot water may be flashed again twice (double flash plant) or three times (triple flash) at progressively lower pressures and temperatures, to obtain more steam.

EGS technology is centred on engineering and creating large heat exchange areas in hot rock. The process involves enhancing permeability by opening pre-existing fractures and/or creating new fractures. Heat is extracted by pumping a transfer medium, typically water, down a borehole into the hot fractured rock and then pumping the heated fluid up another borehole to a power plant, from where it is pumped back down (recirculated) to repeat the cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>* 32 EGS plants worldwide, with 14 of them still in operation (Austria, El Salvador, France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States) \n",

Also, the high temperatures allow for very high efficiencies together with a Brayton cycle. However, VHTRs would not permit use of a closed fuel cycle  . Reference designs are for around 250 MW of electricity, or 600 MW of heat, with a helium coolant and a graphite-moderated thermal neutron spectrum. Fuel would be in the form of coated particles, formed either into rods or pebbles according to the core design adopted. VHTR designs are based on prototype high-temperature gas-cooled reactors built and operated in the United States and Germany, and much R&amp;D has been completed. Key challenges for the VHTR (temperature 1000 deg) include developing improved high temperature-resistant materials, and the fuel design and manufacture. In the meantime, the technology exists to build and operate High Temperature Reactors (with outlet temperatures up to 750-900 deg). China has constructed the HTR-PM (750°C, with Rankine cycle) to be connected to the grid in 2020. Japan has a test reactor (HTTR) which operated for several hours with 950°C outlet temperatures.

The manufacturing of c-Si modules typically involves growing ingots of silicon, slicing the ingots into wafers to make solar cells, electrically interconnecting the cells, and encapsulating the strings of cells to form a module. Modules currently use silicon in one of two main forms: single- (sc-Si) or multi- (mc-Si) crystalline modules. Current commercial single-crystalline modules have a higher conversion efficiency of around 14 to 20\\%. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 25\\% in the longer term. Multi-crystalline silicon modules have a more disordered atomic structure leading to lower efficiencies, but they are less expensive. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 21\\% in the long term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & * Crystalline silicon technology is the dominating technology today, wih a share of around 95\\% in total PV cell production in 2017                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & US-DOE SunShot 2030 targets:\n",

This approach enables a broader spectrum of sunlight to be captured, and overall efficiency to be increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & Multi-junction PV modules are mainly used for satellite PV and concentrating PV (CPV) systems.

Also, the production processes for large-area modules have not yet been developed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & Materials            , Renewable electricity, Systems integration  , Hydrogen             , Synthetic fuels       & NULL\\\\\n",

A synthetic oil transfers the heat from the collector pipes to heat exchangers, producing superheated steam to run a steam turbine and produce electricity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & Parabolic troughs accounted in 2018 with a capacity of 4114 MW for around three quarters of global solar thermal electricity capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & US-DOE SunShot 2030 targets:\n",

The main advantage of LFR systems is that their simple design of flexibly bent mirrors and fixed receivers requires lower investment costs and facilitates direct steam generation, thereby eliminating the need for – and cost of – heat transfer fluids and heat exchangers. LFR plants are, however, less efficient than troughs in converting solar energy to electricity and it is more difficult to incorporate storage capacity into their design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & Linear fresnel reflectors accounted in 2018 with a capacity of 185 MW for 4\\% of global solar thermal electricity capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & US-DOE SunShot 2030 targets:\n",

There is a diversity of designs of AWES but these can be broadly categorised as either lift type devices creating torque on a ground generator via their tether, or drag type devices with airborne generators and conductive tethers. AWES offer several potential advantages over conventional wind turbines. They require less material than towerbased turbines, have the potential to be manufactured at lower cost, can be deployed faster and can harness stronger and steadier winds by flying at higher altitudes. AWES technologies are at varying stages of maturity for a variety of applications ranging from small scale off grid power provision in remote locations to large scale offshore power production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       & After successful onshore tests Makani Power started to test in 2019 a 600 kW kite offshore in non-power generating flight.

The energy capture and power generation technology is fundamentally similar to that onshore. Offshore turbines are marinised and configured for optimal operation in the offshore environment. There is a diversity of foundation types including monopiles, multi-piles, gravity foundations and suction caissons. These may be associated with particular support structures including tubular towers, jackets, tripods, lattice towers and hybrids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & There is likely to be a further divergence of offshore technologies from onshore in the future as the Offshore Wind Power Plant (including the grid connection) is further optimised for offshore operations.

Offshore wind turbines do not face similar transport size limitations to onshore wind turbines so a divergence in maximum size is also likely to continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & NULL & NULL\\\\\n",

Floating offshore turbines offer the potential for lower seabed impact, simplified installation and decommissioning, and access to additional wind resource at water depths exceeding 50 m to 60 m. Floating platforms may also be attractive for mid-depth projects, where saturation of onshore or near-shore potential or the possibility of standardising floating platform designs do not necessarily need heavy-lift vessels to transport platforms or install turbine towers and nacelles. They may therefore ultimately permit greater upscaling of wind turbines than seabed fixed technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & 12 projects are in operation, with a combined capacity of 57 MW, with project size having increased from 0.08 MW in 2009 to 30 MW by 2017.\n",

In these high-temperature reservoirs, the liquid water component boils, or “flashes,” as pressure drops. Separated steam is piped to a turbine to generate electricity and the remaining hot water may be flashed again twice (double flash plant) or three times (triple flash) at progressively lower pressures and temperatures, to obtain more steam.

EGS technology is centred on engineering and creating large heat exchange areas in hot rock. The process involves enhancing permeability by opening pre-existing fractures and/or creating new fractures. Heat is extracted by pumping a transfer medium, typically water, down a borehole into the hot fractured rock and then pumping the heated fluid up another borehole to a power plant, from where it is pumped back down (recirculated) to repeat the cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & * 32 EGS plants worldwide, with 14 of them still in operation (Austria, El Salvador, France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States) \n",

Also, the high temperatures allow for very high efficiencies together with a Brayton cycle. However, VHTRs would not permit use of a closed fuel cycle  . Reference designs are for around 250 MW of electricity, or 600 MW of heat, with a helium coolant and a graphite-moderated thermal neutron spectrum. Fuel would be in the form of coated particles, formed either into rods or pebbles according to the core design adopted. VHTR designs are based on prototype high-temperature gas-cooled reactors built and operated in the United States and Germany, and much R\\&D has been completed. Key challenges for the VHTR (temperature 1000 deg) include developing improved high temperature-resistant materials, and the fuel design and manufacture. In the meantime, the technology exists to build and operate High Temperature Reactors (with outlet temperatures up to 750-900 deg).

Typically, oxygen is commercially produced via low-temperature air separation. Lowering the energy consumption and cost for oxygen production (via improved low-temperature air separation or air-separating membranes, or by generating oxygen during periods of low-cost power, e.g. during night time), and the overall oxyfuel process, are key factors in reducing capture costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & The development of oxyfuel capture and oxygen production technologies have been driven by several research centres, universities and private companies, in particular industrial gas producers (e.g. Air Liquide, Air Products, Linde, Praxair).

The synthesis gas is shifted in a water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction to produce additional hydrogen and convert the carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is then captured from the shifted syngas using physical seperation processes, such as adsorption, and afterward, the remaining hydrogen (H2) is combusted in a combined-cycle gas turbine that generates power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & Pre-combustion capture has been demonstrated at existing coal-fired IGCC power plants\n",

The manufacturing of c-Si modules typically involves growing ingots of silicon, slicing the ingots into wafers to make solar cells, electrically interconnecting the cells, and encapsulating the strings of cells to form a module. Modules currently use silicon in one of two main forms: single- (sc-Si) or multi- (mc-Si) crystalline modules. Current commercial single-crystalline modules have a higher conversion efficiency of around 14 to 20%. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 25% in the longer term. Multi-crystalline silicon modules have a more disordered atomic structure leading to lower efficiencies, but they are less expensive. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 21% in the long term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | * Crystalline silicon technology is the dominating technology today, wih a share of around 95% in total PV cell production in 2017                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | US-DOE SunShot 2030 targets:\n",

This approach enables a broader spectrum of sunlight to be captured, and overall efficiency to be increased.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Multi-junction PV modules are mainly used for satellite PV and concentrating PV (CPV) systems.

Also, the production processes for large-area modules have not yet been developed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Materials            , Renewable electricity, Systems integration  , Hydrogen             , Synthetic fuels       | NULL |\n",

A synthetic oil transfers the heat from the collector pipes to heat exchangers, producing superheated steam to run a steam turbine and produce electricity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Parabolic troughs accounted in 2018 with a capacity of 4114 MW for around three quarters of global solar thermal electricity capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | US-DOE SunShot 2030 targets:\n",

The main advantage of LFR systems is that their simple design of flexibly bent mirrors and fixed receivers requires lower investment costs and facilitates direct steam generation, thereby eliminating the need for – and cost of – heat transfer fluids and heat exchangers. LFR plants are, however, less efficient than troughs in converting solar energy to electricity and it is more difficult to incorporate storage capacity into their design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Linear fresnel reflectors accounted in 2018 with a capacity of 185 MW for 4% of global solar thermal electricity capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | US-DOE SunShot 2030 targets:\n",

There is a diversity of designs of AWES but these can be broadly categorised as either lift type devices creating torque on a ground generator via their tether, or drag type devices with airborne generators and conductive tethers. AWES offer several potential advantages over conventional wind turbines. They require less material than towerbased turbines, have the potential to be manufactured at lower cost, can be deployed faster and can harness stronger and steadier winds by flying at higher altitudes. AWES technologies are at varying stages of maturity for a variety of applications ranging from small scale off grid power provision in remote locations to large scale offshore power production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | After successful onshore tests Makani Power started to test in 2019 a 600 kW kite offshore in non-power generating flight.

Offshore wind turbines do not face similar transport size limitations to onshore wind turbines so a divergence in maximum size is also likely to continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | NULL | NULL |\n",

Floating offshore turbines offer the potential for lower seabed impact, simplified installation and decommissioning, and access to additional wind resource at water depths exceeding 50 m to 60 m. Floating platforms may also be attractive for mid-depth projects, where saturation of onshore or near-shore potential or the possibility of standardising floating platform designs do not necessarily need heavy-lift vessels to transport platforms or install turbine towers and nacelles. They may therefore ultimately permit greater upscaling of wind turbines than seabed fixed technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 12 projects are in operation, with a combined capacity of 57 MW, with project size having increased from 0.08 MW in 2009 to 30 MW by 2017.\n",

In these high-temperature reservoirs, the liquid water component boils, or “flashes,” as pressure drops. Separated steam is piped to a turbine to generate electricity and the remaining hot water may be flashed again twice (double flash plant) or three times (triple flash) at progressively lower pressures and temperatures, to obtain more steam.

EGS technology is centred on engineering and creating large heat exchange areas in hot rock. The process involves enhancing permeability by opening pre-existing fractures and/or creating new fractures. Heat is extracted by pumping a transfer medium, typically water, down a borehole into the hot fractured rock and then pumping the heated fluid up another borehole to a power plant, from where it is pumped back down (recirculated) to repeat the cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | * 32 EGS plants worldwide, with 14 of them still in operation (Austria, El Salvador, France, Germany, United Kingdom, United States) \n",

Also, the high temperatures allow for very high efficiencies together with a Brayton cycle. However, VHTRs would not permit use of a closed fuel cycle  . Reference designs are for around 250 MW of electricity, or 600 MW of heat, with a helium coolant and a graphite-moderated thermal neutron spectrum. Fuel would be in the form of coated particles, formed either into rods or pebbles according to the core design adopted. VHTR designs are based on prototype high-temperature gas-cooled reactors built and operated in the United States and Germany, and much R&amp;D has been completed. Key challenges for the VHTR (temperature 1000 deg) include developing improved high temperature-resistant materials, and the fuel design and manufacture. In the meantime, the technology exists to build and operate High Temperature Reactors (with outlet temperatures up to 750-900 deg). China has constructed the HTR-PM (750°C, with Rankine cycle) to be connected to the grid in 2020. Japan has a test reactor (HTTR) which operated for several hours with 950°C outlet temperatures.

Light water reactor (LWR) SMR designs are based on existing commercial LWR technology but are generally small enough to allow all major reactor components to be placed in a single pressure vessel (i.e. integral designs).

Typically, oxygen is commercially produced via low-temperature air separation. Lowering the energy consumption and cost for oxygen production (via improved low-temperature air separation or air-separating membranes, or by generating oxygen during periods of low-cost power, e.g. during night time), and the overall oxyfuel process, are key factors in reducing capture costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | The development of oxyfuel capture and oxygen production technologies have been driven by several research centres, universities and private companies, in particular industrial gas producers (e.g. Air Liquide, Air Products, Linde, Praxair).

The synthesis gas is shifted in a water-gas-shift (WGS) reaction to produce additional hydrogen and convert the carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is then captured from the shifted syngas using physical seperation processes, such as adsorption, and afterward, the remaining hydrogen (H2) is combusted in a combined-cycle gas turbine that generates power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Pre-combustion capture has been demonstrated at existing coal-fired IGCC power plants\n",

       "1   Today, the vast majority of PV modules are based on wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si). The manufacturing of c-Si modules typically involves growing ingots of silicon, slicing the ingots into wafers to make solar cells, electrically interconnecting the cells, and encapsulating the strings of cells to form a module. Modules currently use silicon in one of two main forms: single- (sc-Si) or multi- (mc-Si) crystalline modules. Current commercial single-crystalline modules have a higher conversion efficiency of around 14 to 20%. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 25% in the longer term. Multi-crystalline silicon modules have a more disordered atomic structure leading to lower efficiencies, but they are less expensive. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 21% in the long term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "4   Multi-junction cell design involves superposing several cells in a stack. In the case of two cells, it will form a double junction, also called a tandem cell. Stacking more cells together forms a triple or a quadruple junction. In all cases, the upper cell(s) must be as transparent as possible to enable the lower cells to still be active.

       "9   Parabolic trough systems consist of parallel rows of mirrors (reflectors) curved in one dimension to focus the sun’s rays. Stainless steel pipes (absorber tubes) with a selective coating serve as the heat collectors and are insulated in an evacuated glass envelope. The reflectors and the absorber tubes move in tandem with the sun as it crosses the sky. A synthetic oil transfers the heat from the collector pipes to heat exchangers, producing superheated steam to run a steam turbine and produce electricity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "10  Linear Fresnel reflectors (LFRs) approximate the parabolic shape of trough systems but by using long rows of flat or slightly curved mirrors to reflect the sun’s rays onto a downward-facing linear, fixed receiver. The main advantage of LFR systems is that their simple design of flexibly bent mirrors and fixed receivers requires lower investment costs and facilitates direct steam generation, thereby eliminating the need for – and cost of – heat transfer fluids and heat exchangers. LFR plants are, however, less efficient than troughs in converting solar energy to electricity and it is more difficult to incorporate storage capacity into their design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "14  Compared with mainstream offshore fixed structure mounted turbines, floating offshore wind turbines have no foundation on the sea-floor, but are instead based on either floating (barge), semi-submersible, tension leg or spar platforms, kept in place by different mooring and anchoring systems. Floating offshore turbines offer the potential for lower seabed impact, simplified installation and decommissioning, and access to additional wind resource at water depths exceeding 50 m to 60 m. Floating platforms may also be attractive for mid-depth projects, where saturation of onshore or near-shore potential or the possibility of standardising floating platform designs do not necessarily need heavy-lift vessels to transport platforms or install turbine towers and nacelles. They may therefore ultimately permit greater upscaling of wind turbines than seabed fixed technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "21  Enhanced or engineered geothermal systems aim at using the heat of the Earth where no or insufficient steam or hot water exists and where permeability is low. EGS technology is centred on engineering and creating large heat exchange areas in hot rock. The process involves enhancing permeability by opening pre-existing fractures and/or creating new fractures. Heat is extracted by pumping a transfer medium, typically water, down a borehole into the hot fractured rock and then pumping the heated fluid up another borehole to a power plant, from where it is pumped back down (recirculated) to repeat the cycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

Usually operated in baseload but all Gen III designs have the ability to operate flexibly (load following).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "23  Several sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) have already been built and operated in several countries, making it one of the best established Generation IV technologies. SFRs feature a fast neutron spectrum, liquid sodium coolant, and a closed fuel cycle. Full-sized designs (up to 1 500 MW  ) most use mixed uranium plutonium oxide fuel, as part of future closed nuclear fuel cycles with multi-recycling of nuclear materials.\\nFrance operated for a number of years the 1200 MWe Superphenix industrial prototype that demonstrated the operational performance of the technology with MOX fuel at industrial scale. Russia has operated commercial SFRs for many years. The 600 MW BN-600 has been operating since 1980, and the 800 MW BN-800 was connected to the grid in 2015..  Small designs in the 100 MW range  , are also being considered. SFRs have a higher (550C) outlet temperature than light water reactors, increasing the range of possible non-electricity applications. Reducing capital costs and increasing passive safety are important R&D aims, together with the industrial deployment of advanced fuel reprocessing technologies. \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "24  A key attribute of the very high temperature reactor (VHTR) concept is its ability to produce the higher temperatures  (up to 1 000°C) needed for large scale hydrogen production using thermo-chemical cycles and some high temperature process heat applications. Also, the high temperatures allow for very high efficiencies together with a Brayton cycle. However, VHTRs would not permit use of a closed fuel cycle  . Reference designs are for around 250 MW of electricity, or 600 MW of heat, with a helium coolant and a graphite-moderated thermal neutron spectrum. Fuel would be in the form of coated particles, formed either into rods or pebbles according to the core design adopted. VHTR designs are based on prototype high-temperature gas-cooled reactors built and operated in the United States and Germany, and much R&D has been completed. Key challenges for the VHTR (temperature 1000 deg) include developing improved high temperature-resistant materials, and the fuel design and manufacture. In the meantime, the technology exists to build and operate High Temperature Reactors (with outlet temperatures up to 750-900 deg). China has constructed the HTR-PM (750°C, with Rankine cycle) to be connected to the grid in 2020. Japan has a test reactor (HTTR) which operated for several hours with 950°C outlet temperatures. It is due to restart in 2020.\n",
       "25  Small modular reactors are defined as reactors with an electric generating capacity of up to 300 MW. Light water reactor (LWR) SMR designs are based on existing commercial LWR technology but are generally small enough to allow all major reactor components to be placed in a single pressure vessel (i.e. integral designs). The reactor vessel and its components are designed to be assembled in a factory and transported to the plant site for installation, potentially reducing construction time and costs compared to those of large LWRs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

The majority of OLEDs today use the small-molecular subtype.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "413 Polymer light-emitting diodes (PLED) is a type of OLED, using large molecules (polymers) typically deposited using a solution-based method (e.g. inkjet printing or screen printing) which is cheaper than high-vacuum evaporation used for small-molecular OLEDs, but comes at the expense of lifetime and efficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Efficiencies are much lower than silicon-based PV systems, but production costs are also expected to be much lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "6   The technology is still at the laboratory stage. The instability of perovskite solar cells continues to present the greatest problem. The crystal lattice is very sensitive to environmental influences. In conditions with too much moisture, heat or UV light, it changes, losing its ability to transform light into power. Also, the production processes for large-area modules have not yet been developed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Offshore wind turbines do not face similar transport size limitations to onshore wind turbines so a divergence in maximum size is also likely to continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

The SFR utilises depleted uranium as the fuel matrix and has a coolant temperature of 500-550°C enabling electricity generation via a intermediate sodium loop, the primary one being at near atmospheric pressure. Three variants are proposed: a 50-150 MWe modular type with actinides incorporated into a U-Pu metal fuel requiring electrometallurgical processing (pyroprocessing) integrated on site; a 300-1500 MWe pool-type version of this; and a 600-1500 MWe loop-type with conventional MOX fuel, potentially with minor actinides, and advanced aqueous reprocessing in central facilities elsewhere.\\n\\nDevelopment is usually led by government and public R&D organisations (because of the high specialization of the required research infrastructures). But, also private companies are promoting SFR-type designs for large scale or SMR type reactors, for example Framatome, GE Hitachi (PRISM reactor, on which the technology of the US Versatile Test Reactor is based) and several SMR companies (for example ARC in Canada or Terrapower in the US  ).\\n\\nGeneration IV International Forum (GIF): Inter-governmental cooperation are taking place on the SFR system, along with the other 5 reference systems.\n",

       "418 * In France, 13 million of electric water heaters with storage tanks (up to 8GW during night periods in winter) are switched on/off according to a predefined schedule. 175hz PLC control signals are sent through the distribution grid.\\n* In Great Britain, the vast majority of customers with storage heaters (1.7m) are on ToU tariffs such as Economy 7 and have their meter controlled by radio teleswitch devices. Over 1.3m of them are on 'static' switching schedules, but around 200,000 meters are 'dynamically' controlled, with switching schedules changing on a daily basis\\nIn both cases, smart meters are expected to take over in the future. Some other countries (US, New Zealand, etc) also have other load management schemes, sometimes incentive-based.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "429 Saline formations have been used for CO2 storage at commercial scale in a number of CCUS projects (Sleipner, Snøhvit, Quest). The following projects exemplify the ambition of leading players to develop much larger (5 to 50 MtCO2/yr) storage operations:\\n* The Northern Lights project involves an offshore saline storage site beneath the Northern North Sea. The project involves two phases: for phase 1 a storage rate of up to 1.5 MtCO2/year is planned; during phase 2 the storage rate will rise up to 5 MtCO2/yr.\\n* The CarbonNet project is developing a deep saline CO2 storage site within the Gippsland Basin in Victoria, Australia, with a capacity of 125 MtCO2. A hub-based network centred on a large capacity pipeline will be capable of delivering 5 MtCO2/yr.\\n* The CarbonSAFE is a United States initiative focused on development of geological storage sites with CO2 capacities of over 50 MtCO2 across the continental US. The development CarbonSAFE is expected to lead to injection by 2026.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "431 CO2-EOR is a technology that was pioneered in the United States. Initially CO2 was sourced from natural reservoirs, but more recently CO2 captured from industrial sources has been added to pipeline supply networks, for example Petranova. There is growing interest, and some development of CO2-EOR, in other regions including the Middle East, India and China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "432 There is virtually no experience with mineral storage of CO2.  CarbFix is a pilot project in Iceland to demonstrate secure and permanent storage of CO2 in basalt rock formations. CO2, dissolved in water, reacts with the rock to form carbonate minerals. The CarbFix team has demonstrated that over 95% of the injected CO2 was converted into rock in less than two years. The same concept has also been evaluated at the Wallula test site in Washington State, United States, and has been advocated for offshore areas where basalt is widespread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "25  Specific per-MW costs of SMRs are likely to be higher than those of large third generation reactors; however, economies of series could compensate economies of scale if a sufficiently\\nlarge number of identical SMR designs are built and replicated in factory assembly workshops. Achieving regulatory and industrial harmonization is key to foster the economies of volume through a global market. Lower overall investment costs and shorter construction times for SMRs could potentially  facilitate the financing of such reactors compared to large nuclear plants. \\n\n",

Efficiencies are much lower than silicon-based PV systems, but production costs are also expected to be much lower.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "6   The technology is still at the laboratory stage. The instability of perovskite solar cells continues to present the greatest problem. The crystal lattice is very sensitive to environmental influences. In conditions with too much moisture, heat or UV light, it changes, losing its ability to transform light into power. Also, the production processes for large-area modules have not yet been developed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Offshore wind turbines do not face similar transport size limitations to onshore wind turbines so a divergence in maximum size is also likely to continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

The SFR utilises depleted uranium as the fuel matrix and has a coolant temperature of 500-550°C enabling electricity generation via a intermediate sodium loop, the primary one being at near atmospheric pressure. Three variants are proposed: a 50-150 MWe modular type with actinides incorporated into a U-Pu metal fuel requiring electrometallurgical processing (pyroprocessing) integrated on site; a 300-1500 MWe pool-type version of this; and a 600-1500 MWe loop-type with conventional MOX fuel, potentially with minor actinides, and advanced aqueous reprocessing in central facilities elsewhere.\\n\\nDevelopment is usually led by government and public R&D organisations (because of the high specialization of the required research infrastructures). But, also private companies are promoting SFR-type designs for large scale or SMR type reactors, for example Framatome, GE Hitachi (PRISM reactor, on which the technology of the US Versatile Test Reactor is based) and several SMR companies (for example ARC in Canada or Terrapower in the US  ).\\n\\nGeneration IV International Forum (GIF): Inter-governmental cooperation are taking place on the SFR system, along with the other 5 reference systems.\n",

       "418 * In France, 13 million of electric water heaters with storage tanks (up to 8GW during night periods in winter) are switched on/off according to a predefined schedule. 175hz PLC control signals are sent through the distribution grid.\\n* In Great Britain, the vast majority of customers with storage heaters (1.7m) are on ToU tariffs such as Economy 7 and have their meter controlled by radio teleswitch devices. Over 1.3m of them are on 'static' switching schedules, but around 200,000 meters are 'dynamically' controlled, with switching schedules changing on a daily basis\\nIn both cases, smart meters are expected to take over in the future. Some other countries (US, New Zealand, etc) also have other load management schemes, sometimes incentive-based.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "429 Saline formations have been used for CO2 storage at commercial scale in a number of CCUS projects (Sleipner, Snøhvit, Quest). The following projects exemplify the ambition of leading players to develop much larger (5 to 50 MtCO2/yr) storage operations:\\n* The Northern Lights project involves an offshore saline storage site beneath the Northern North Sea. The project involves two phases: for phase 1 a storage rate of up to 1.5 MtCO2/year is planned; during phase 2 the storage rate will rise up to 5 MtCO2/yr.\\n* The CarbonNet project is developing a deep saline CO2 storage site within the Gippsland Basin in Victoria, Australia, with a capacity of 125 MtCO2. A hub-based network centred on a large capacity pipeline will be capable of delivering 5 MtCO2/yr.\\n* The CarbonSAFE is a United States initiative focused on development of geological storage sites with CO2 capacities of over 50 MtCO2 across the continental US. The development CarbonSAFE is expected to lead to injection by 2026.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "431 CO2-EOR is a technology that was pioneered in the United States. Initially CO2 was sourced from natural reservoirs, but more recently CO2 captured from industrial sources has been added to pipeline supply networks, for example Petranova. There is growing interest, and some development of CO2-EOR, in other regions including the Middle East, India and China.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "432 There is virtually no experience with mineral storage of CO2.  CarbFix is a pilot project in Iceland to demonstrate secure and permanent storage of CO2 in basalt rock formations. CO2, dissolved in water, reacts with the rock to form carbonate minerals. The CarbFix team has demonstrated that over 95% of the injected CO2 was converted into rock in less than two years. The same concept has also been evaluated at the Wallula test site in Washington State, United States, and has been advocated for offshore areas where basalt is widespread.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
