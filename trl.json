    "description": "Today, the vast majority of PV modules are based on wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si). The manufacturing of c-Si modules typically involves growing ingots of silicon, slicing the ingots into wafers to make solar cells, electrically interconnecting the cells, and encapsulating the strings of cells to form a module. Modules currently use silicon in one of two main forms: single- (sc-Si) or multi- (mc-Si) crystalline modules. Current commercial single-crystalline modules have a higher conversion efficiency of around 14 to 20%. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 25% in the longer term. Multi-crystalline silicon modules have a more disordered atomic structure leading to lower efficiencies, but they are less expensive. Their efficiency is expected to increase up to 21% in the long term.",

    "description": "Compared with mainstream offshore fixed structure mounted turbines, floating offshore wind turbines have no foundation on the sea-floor, but are instead based on either floating (barge), semi-submersible, tension leg or spar platforms, kept in place by different mooring and anchoring systems. Floating offshore turbines offer the potential for lower seabed impact, simplified installation and decommissioning, and access to additional wind resource at water depths exceeding 50 m to 60 m. Floating platforms may also be attractive for mid-depth projects, where saturation of onshore or near-shore potential or the possibility of standardising floating platform designs do not necessarily need heavy-lift vessels to transport platforms or install turbine towers and nacelles. They may therefore ultimately permit greater upscaling of wind turbines than seabed fixed technology.",

Also, the high temperatures allow for very high efficiencies together with a Brayton cycle. However, VHTRs would not permit use of a closed fuel cycle  . Reference designs are for around 250 MW of electricity, or 600 MW of heat, with a helium coolant and a graphite-moderated thermal neutron spectrum. Fuel would be in the form of coated particles, formed either into rods or pebbles according to the core design adopted. VHTR designs are based on prototype high-temperature gas-cooled reactors built and operated in the United States and Germany, and much R&D has been completed. Key challenges for the VHTR (temperature 1000 deg) include developing improved high temperature-resistant materials, and the fuel design and manufacture. In the meantime, the technology exists to build and operate High Temperature Reactors (with outlet temperatures up to 750-900 deg). China has constructed the HTR-PM (750°C, with Rankine cycle) to be connected to the grid in 2020. Japan has a test reactor (HTTR) which operated for several hours with 950°C outlet temperatures. It is due to restart in 2020.",

    "description": "Ocean technologies are a broad technology family, encompassing a range of designs to generate electricity from energy in the sea, generally either in wave or tidal form. Tidal power harnesses energy from tides in a similar way to wind power. Ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) draws thermal energy from the deep ocean and convert it into electricity or commodities. Salinity gradient power is energy produced from the chemical pressure that results from the difference in salt concentration between fresh water and saltwater. This can therefore be exploited at river mouths where fresh and saline water meet. Two technologies are being developed to convert this energy into electricity: pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) and reverse electrodialysis (RED). Finally, ocean current technology can harvest energy from sea currents, which always flow in one direction and are driven by wind, water temperature, water salinity and density among other factors; they are part of the thermohaline convection system that moves water around the world.",

    "description": "Tidal stream turbines harness the flow of ocean currents in the same way that wind turbines harness the flow of wind. Tidal stream turbines can be mounted directly on the seabed or floating and moored to the seabed. Technologies are approaching commercialisation, with the testing of full-scale devices in real-sea conditions, led by European companies. The design of tidal stream turbines is approaching design convergence. Converging designs generally comprise two- to three-bladed horizontal-axis turbines. Alternative designs include: vertical axis turbines, which work under the same principles as horizontal axis turbines, except the rotor turns on a vertical axis; oscillating hydrofoils, that have a hydrofoil attached to an oscillating arm, which is lifted by the tidal stream to generate power; enclosed tips, or Venturi Effect devices increase the velocity of the tidal stream by funnelling it through a duct; tidal kites, which are tethered to the seabed with a turbine attached below its ‘wing’, and ‘flies’ in a figure-of-eight path to exaggerate the speed of the waterflow through the turbine; and Archimedes screws, a helical corkscrew device which draws power from the tidal stream as the water flows up the spiral, turning the turbine [1].\n\nTidal stream has reached a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of between 6 and 8, depending on device type. Devices and their auxiliary technology are expected to reach commercialisation following around ten years (estimated) of further research, development and real-sea experience. The rated power of existing tidal technology ranges between smaller-scale devices of 0.1-0.25 MW, and larger scale of 1 and 2 MW, with scope to increase by 50% or more in coming years. Tidal stream’s progress in recent years is demonstrated by the operating hours accumulated, capacity deployed and electricity generated, with companies operating at all scales active in Europe and globally. Since 2010, over 26.8 MW of tidal stream has been deployed in Europe, and more globally. 11.9 MW of this is currently operating, and 14.9 MW has now been decommissioned [1].",

    "description": "Wave Energy Converters (WECs) harness the energy contained in the movement of the waves. WEC placement is flexible; WECs can be deployed on or near the shoreline, or at a distance of over 100 metres from the shore. Wave technology remains at an earlier stage of development than tidal stream technology, with novel device prototypes undergoing testing in real sea conditions. A range of innovative wave device design concepts are in testing globally; wave energy is comparatively further from technological convergence. Successful design convergence may not resemble that of tidal technology; instead, a wider variety of different designs may be successful, given the broad spectrum of feasible ways to harness energy from the waves. Wave prototypes are currently found in four main forms. The point absorber is a floating structure that absorbs energy through the movement of the waves at the water’s surface. The attenuator sits across the wave front, capturing energy by selectively constraining the movement caused by the passing wave. The hinged flap is mounted on the seabed in shallower water, and harnesses energy through an oscillating flap. Finally, the Oscillating Water Column (OWC) is a partially-submerged, hollow structure open to the sea water below the surface, trapping air above the water. The rising and falling waves compress and decompress this air, which is channelled through an air turbine. WEC technology developers are seeking to improve the power rating of their devices through design optimisation. This will allow proving of the technology at higher TRLs, and proceed to commercialisation [1].\n",

    "description": "Flywheels are powered by electricity and can store electrical energy as rotating inertia. The discharging process transforms the flywheel movement back into electricity through a generator. Air friction is commonly reduced by putting the flywheel inside a vacuum and rotating friction minimised by using magnetically levitated bearings, leading to high efficiencies of 90%-95%. The energy output tends to be small, so flywheels are limited to short-time applications such as area regulation or load following. The rapid response time, low maintenance requirements and very high cycle life (i.e. can undergo a large number of charging and discharging cycles) are also important characteristics for short-term applications to maintain power quality. Also, flywheel storage can provide both up and down regulation during the same time period (although not simultaneously).",

The charging system is an industrial air liquefaction plant where electricity is used to liquefy air. The liquid air is stored in an insulated tank at low pressure. When power is required, liquid air is drawn from the tank, pumped to high pressure, and evaporated. This produces gaseous air that can be used to drive a piston engine or turbine to do valuable work that can be used to generate electricity. The stored compression heat can be used to increase the work output. Alternatively, (waste) heat from an industrial process, a gas turbine or other conventional power station can be used to heat up the air before expansion.

Increasing non-synchronous generators in the form of solar photovoltaics and wind farms results in a decreases of system inertia, and to more frequency instability - as does the decrease in synchronous machines from the phase-out of conventional generation. \n\nVirtual inertia can be a solution that addresses these concerns, when utilised with appropriate control structures and technologies.  Virtual inertia can be developed for virable renewables by using a short term energy storage together with a power inverter/converter and a proper control mechanism. This is known as virtual synchronous generator, virtual synchronous machine or synchronverters.

However, static line ratings cause significant under utilisation of transmission assets, as conservative conditions rarely come to fruition beyond a few hours a day. Dynamic line rating (DLR) systems change in response to real-time weather conditions and allow transmission system operators (TSOs) to efficiently and effectively utilise assets by varying the amount of current that can flow through a line. This helps TSOs manage congestion and increases a grid's resilience and reliability. For instance, DLR systems can increase the power capacity of an existing by 10-30% for around 90% of the time.

This \"syngas\" is then sent to a water-gas shift (WGS) reactor to increase the H2/CO ratio required for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, and CO2 is separated and vented. The syngas is fed into the FT reactor, and the resulting liquid hydrocarbons are cleaned, refined, and separated into diesel, jet fuel, naptha and other products. The biomass used to produce BTL are not food crops, avoiding direct competition with food and unwanted land-use change.

They operate at high temperatures and require a source of heat (such as waste heat, bioenergy or nuclear energy) which means they may well be attractive for co-location and integration with other industrial or chemical processes.

The ATR and GHR are in series and the GHR acts both as a pre-heater and cooler of the inlet/outlet of the ATR. The GHR benefit is that it pre-reforms the gas going to ATR using the heat from the exhaust gases of the ATR and performs part of the reforming that would otherwise take place in the ATR. The main technical challenge for GHR is carbon deposition (metal dusting) on the shell side (high temperature from the ATR outlet at around 1100C to 600-800C). This can be solved by either material selection that can withstand the conditions and thermal cycling (cost) or by either decreasing the operating pressure or adding more steam, both of which come with penalty in process efficiency",

Platooning refers to trucks that closely follow each other and are equipped with state-of-the-art driving support, forming a platoon of trucks driven by smart vehicle communication and automation (CAV) technologies. This allows trucks to drive closer together at near-constant speeds, which reduces air resistance (and thereby fuel consumption) and increases the capacity of roads.

    "description": "This technology can be applied in vehicles (typically heavy duty) powered by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by biomethane. The biomethane is stored in a tank kept at high pressure (20-25 MPa). Technical challenges that apply to this technology mostly relate to methane slip (leakage) in the engine, which occurs at the inlet manifold (before the actual air supply to the cylinder) and from the cylinder due to incomplete combustion. Low pressure premixed injection engines have higher slip (5% unburnt methane in the exhaust gas) than direct injection high pressure gas engines (reference: Advanced Motor Fuels Technology Collaboration Programme Annex 51). For this technology to deliver net emissions reductions, the methane would need to be produced from renewable sources (e.g. biomethane or synthetic methane) and burned in direct injection high pressure gas engines, as use of fossil methane in current engine technologies has no CO2 emissions benefit relative to diesel powertrains. Further technology development to avoid gas slip from the manifold are also required. \nExhaust gas after-treatment catalysts should also be enhanced to compensate for the fact that oxidising of methane molecules is difficult, especially at low temperatures (e.g. during engine warm-up, or when the engine is running at low loads). Indeed, since after-treatment of stoichiometric combustion is a far more cost-effective option for reducing methane and other pollutant emissions than both direct injection and diesel lean combustion, most current research efforts focus on enhancing after-treatment systems.

    "description": "A hydrogen fuel cell system generates electric power from hydrogen. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) have much smaller batteries than battery electric vehicles (at least by a factor of 10), as the energy is stored in the hydrogen. By exploiting the higher gravimetric energy density of hydrogen, FCEVs can offer a higher ranges than BEVs. However their continuing deployment faces multiple technical and economic challenges, including: safety of hydrogen handling (refuelling, residual leakage), on-board hydrogen storage (see the dedicated entry below) and the high cost of the fuel cell stack (the electrochemical reaction inside the stack requires a proton exchange membrane (PEM) coated with a platinum-based catalyst, a costly material) and system. Costs of the fuel cell stack and system are expected to decline significantly with economies of scale.\nFor FCEVs to be competitive with other powertrain technologies, hydrogen must be delivered to hydrogen refuelling stations at prices that bring per kilometre costs into the same range as conventional ICEs, or of battery electric vehicles powered by grid electricity. This will require further cost reductions in technologies for low- and zero-carbon hydrogen production technologies (e.g. SMR with CCS, renewable electricity generation such as wind and solar coupled to electrolysers), as well as in hydrogen transmission and distribution networks and in hydrogen refueling stations (HRS).",

Multiple options for power transfer are being explored. These can be most generally classified into conductive and inductive transfer. \n\nConductive power transfer concepts can use catenary systems coupled with a pantograph arm (as is being trialled by Siemens and truck OEM partners), or via in-road or road-side rail systems with a connector arm. Such systems can enable high power transfer efficiency. \n\nAt the end of the electrified segment of road the vehicle can continue to draw from its batteries, switching to its engine when operations warrant doing so or when the batteries are fully depleted. This allows EVs to become more flexible, reduces the need for on-board energy capacity in the vehicles themselves, and can accelerate the operations for which electrification is technically viable and economically competitive (i.e. of long-distance freight and other heavy duty modes). The vehicles using ERS can be hybrid, battery-electric, or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and can conduct normal driving operations, such as overtaking and driving autonomously outside of electric roads. With a small but growing number of demonstrations in Sweden and Germany, truck operators like Scania are working with Siemens to gain real-world experience operating catenary ERS systems. Installation costs are around USD 1 million or more per lane-km when dimensioned for traffic flows on the core part of the road network (starting at around 2000 trucks/day), and may fall from that level somewhat in the long term, approaching the magnitudes of rail electrification infrastructure upgrades.",

    "description": "Inductive power transfer was developed early in the 20th century, but the high capacity, safety and reliability required by EVs is still in early stages of development. Static wireless EV charging (i.e. a parking spots, and not an ERS technology concept) provides a relatively user-friendly and safe avenue to charge electric cars, increasing convenience of use and facilitating adoption. Dynamic inductive power transmission could also be implemented if many inductive units (coils) are installed under the road surface of traffic lanes.\nInductive charging has a number of advantages over conductive charging, but also several disadvantages, including lower efficiency, higher material requirements per lane‐km, more invasive changes to the existing infrastructure, and more complex components. Dynamic wireless electric charging holds huge potential as it can address classical EV range concerns through 'in-motion' wireless charging, which allows an EV to charge wirelessly as it’s driving down the road. This also allows for smaller and lighter batteries to be used in EVs, benefitting from charging infrastructure embedded within road infrastructure.

A number of innovations are needed to go beyond high capacity thresholds, including battery and ultracapacitor combinations and integration of high capacity charging equipment within passenger EV and truck frames. Charging stations must provide high power output with minimal impact on the grid, which also will require further integration efforts including application of battery storage, capacitors or smart management systems.

    "description": "Normally, hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) operate at 350 or 700 bars. Most of the stations for passenger cars are designed for operating at 700 bar, while stations for buses typically use 350 bar. For this reason, currently the majority of the stations operate at 700 bars, with many of them operating on a dual basis, being able to deliver fuel to both at 350 and 700 bars.\n\nHydrogen refuelling can be standalone, or linked to a hydrogen production station. If they hydrogen is delivered to the station in intermediary form, storage and compression systems are needed. Hydrogen storage systems are generally low pressure, around 50-200 bar. Compressors overcome the pressure difference between storage and refuelling (which can be up to 1000 bar), and they are a central area of innovation in hydrogen refuelling stations. Most of the time, storage buffers (at 450 or 950 bars) are used to refuel vehicles (without a direct connection of vehicles to compressor outlet).\n\nA range of technologies can be employed for compressing H2 from low pressure states to up to those needed at the point of use, depending on whether hydrogen is in gaseous or liquid form, and on the throughput vehicle type. High levels of purity are needed in fuel cell applications, so technologies like ionic compressors are needed to reduce the possibility of contamination.\n\nDuring compression the hydrogen gas heats up, and precooling systems are needed to stay within the limits of the vehicle’s fuel storage system. These systems add complexity and increase energy consumption, and are a key area of development in improving the efficiency and reducing costs of hydrogen refuelling systems.",

    "description": "Magnetic levitation trains or maglevs are floating vehicles that are supported either by electromagnetic attraction or repulsion. They were initially conceptualised in the early 1900s, and have been in commercial use in some form since 1984. Maglev trains remove friction between the wheels and the rails, allowing for much higher speeds, reducing operating costs from fewer moving parts and rolling friction. In turn this means the main driver impeding forward movement becomes air resistance, driving technology development. They can also improve safety and prevent derailment. Further, they allow for wider trains to be built, increasing convenience; and they reduce the needs for civil engineering projects, as they can operate on higher inclines (of up to 10%) than traditional trains. \n\nTwo key technology areas are currently deployed: (i) electromagnetic suspension (EMS), which harnesses the attractive forces between magnets on the train's side and underside and on the guideway; and (ii) electromagnetic suspension systems, where magnets, generally placed in the undercarriage of the train, repel the train from the guideway, which allows for higher levitation. These are generally based on superconducting and supercooled technology systems. The need to build dedicated infrastructure from scratch, bypassing conventional infrastructure, and high capital expenditures remain obstacles for further deployment.",

    "description": "Establishing a hydrogen bunkering infrastructure is an important step in introducing hydrogen propulsion in ships. However, vessels have not yet been designed, and there isn't currently a bunker vessel standard to work to. The technology systems depend entirely on the method for hydrogen storage (liquid or compressed gas). A vessel that has bunker tanks for liquid hydrogen needs a liquefied hydrogen supply. Compressed gas could be refuelled by a liquid hydrogen bunker vessel equipped with a regasification plant, or if stored as gas in the port, transferred by pressure balancing or compressing the gas into the ship. \n\nThe choice of hydrogen storage method has implications for the technology used to power the vessel.  A gas engine is preferred for liquid hydrogen as the excess heat from combustion can be used to evaporate hydrogen. Gaseous hydrogen generally works better with on-board fuel cells, even if can also be made suitable for gas engines, particularly if co-fired with natural gas. \n\nCost-effective liquefaction chains for hydrogen are key for bunkering, as liquid hydrogen is expected to offer advantages over pressurized hydrogen gas in relation to transportation costs. In contrast with LNG where the gas is transported into the port, the economics of hydrogen mean that hydrogen liquefaction plants are likely to be located close to port, requiring stronger integration between systems. \n\n",

    "description": "There are two aircraft designs that use hydrogen as an energy carrier; hydrogen can either be used to operate a fuel cell on an electric aircraft or used as combustion fuel to power a jet engine. Neither produces direct CO2 emissions during the operation of the aircraft (although the upstream emissions depend on the technologies used to produce and transport the hydrogen). Combustion of hydrogen produces water vapour, which can contribute to global warming.\nIn electric aircraft designs with fuel cell technology, batteries are typically used to regulate power output or as back-up fuel source, but not as primary energy storage. The reduced battery capacity requirements, together with the high energy density of hydrogen per unit mass, alleviate a major constraint of electric flying (related to the low energy density of current batteries that prohibit electric flights beyond short-haul flights).\nMajor manufacturers are exploring fuel cell electric aircraft designs and several small aircraft have been tested. Aircraft designs that use hydrogen as a direct combustion fuel are currently not being tested in passenger aircraft.\nThe low volumetric energy density of hydrogen, about a quarter that of jet kerosene, together with the need to keep cryogenic hydrogen at low temperature, calls for new aircraft design. Fuel tanks may be located in the fuselage rather than in wings to meet flying range requirements, which would reduce the space available for passengers. Existing programmes prioritize cryogenic hydrogen over pressurized hydrogen at ambient temperature, allowing for longer ranges.\nHydrogen aircraft are at an early development stage and commercial application in small regional jets is only expected in the long term. An early application of hydrogen in aircraft will be in auxiliary power units (APU) for non-propulsion applications such as lighting, HVAC, or cabin pressurization.\n",

Introducing a clean sheet design aircraft would disrupt common industry practice of \"incremental improvements\" to existing models, and incur much higher development costs and uncertainty. The high wingspan-to-height ratio of BWB design makes is only suitable for large aircraft, meaning that development costs cannot be split over a model family of different sizes.

Moreover, the turbulent airflow generated by the fuselage results in drag. The integration of the engines at the back of the plane, by the fuselage, would allow for ''boundary layer ingestion'', i.e. ingestion of the turbulent airflow by the engines, which reduces drag and enhances energy efficiency.\nIn the long term, blended wing body designs are well-adapted to propulsion-airframe integration. In association to distributed propulsion (i.e. propulsive force being generated by multiple small engines/fans), this would pave the way to further energy consumption reductions. Among the challenges of this solution are the difficulties to introduce disruptive designs, safety (from the engines being close to each other and to the cabin), trim control, core engine and fan ability to intake turbulent air, and integration of large diameter engines (see UHBR engines).",

Hybrid electric aircraft use jet fuel and may be equipped with a small battery to moderate power output. The electric motor enjoys higher conversion efficiency than a combustion engine (e.g. turboprop or turbofans), thus increasing the overall efficiency of the aircraft. \nAirbus together with Rolls Royce was developing a prototype for a hybrid-electric aircraft under the E-Fan X program. Previous to April 2020, they aimed at launching a test flight by 2021 with an aircraft fitted with one electric motor and three regular jet engines. (Source) Wright Electric develops a 186-seat electric aircraft for short-haul range and aims for a market introduction in 2030. The company collaborates with EasyJet and Airbus and at this stage does not specify how the electric engine would be powered – considering available batteries it seems safe to assume that this will be hybrid electric.

The CO2 used in building materials is permanently stored in the product. CO2-cured concrete can deliver lower costs compared to conventionally-produced concrete, while building materials from waste and CO2 can be competitive in some cases as it avoids the cost associated with conventional waste disposal. Producing building materials from waste can be energy intensive, in particular the pre-treatment and post-treatment steps.
